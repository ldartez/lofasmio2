# lofasmio2 C++ package
## A set of LoFASM tools to facilitate a better data analysis pipeline

### Hopefully, this will merge with the original lofasmio project soon.

# Package heirarchy:
lofasmio2 is built as a set of individual tools. Each tool will have its
source code reside in `lofasmio2/src/<toolname>/` and headers in 
`lofasmio2/include/<toolname>/`.
